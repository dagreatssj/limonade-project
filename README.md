A Limonade-project
=================================================

## What is this?

I create a website for a friend of mine about 2 years ago now, using the limonade php micro framework (http://limonade-php.github.io)
called Grimhearts1985. I have included here a skeleton of his site so that if you are interested in use limonade you can get a very
clear idea on how to use. I have to say that I really like this micro-framework it is very easy to maintain and keeps your code very 
neat.
